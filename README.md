# blake2

This library provides the [BLAKE2](https://blake2.net/) hash algorithms. While
[cryptonite](https://github.com/haskell-crypto/cryptonite) also provides a
BLAKE2 implementation, this library has fewer dependencies and a richer API for
features like keyed hashing and variable length output.
